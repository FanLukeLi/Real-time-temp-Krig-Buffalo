stages of the pipeline: 
    build docker image <- current datetime as id
    register image <- GitHub Container Registry (Free tier)
    deploy <- Azure Kubernetes Service

    [3/29/2025]: the pipeline plan changed to the following, because integrating a python environment to prepare data for the app
                 to the Jenkins server is not efficient
        build: 
            build docker image: 
                from conda image
                copy kriging_app folder
                building environment
                run prepare_grid.py
                deploy app
        deploy: 
            register docker image to ghcr
            deploy with AKS
