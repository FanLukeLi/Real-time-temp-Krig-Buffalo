stages of the pipeline: 
    build docker image <- current datetime as id
    register image <- GitHub Container Registry (Free tier)
    deploy <- Azure Kubernetes Service

    [3/29/2025]: the pipeline plan changed to the following, because integrating a python environment to prepare data for the app
                 to the Jenkins server is not efficient
        build: 
            build docker image: 
                from conda image
                copy kriging_app folder
                building environment
                run prepare_grid.py
                deploy app
        deploy: 
            register docker image to ghcr
            deploy with AKS

    [3/30/2025]: the pipeline changed to the following, because open-meteo API has access limit in free tier, deploying multiple
                 workers or replicas of the container will exceed the limit, in future builds, there will be one app collecting 
                 the data from open-meteo, but multiple workers or K8s pods for map access (frontend)
        build: 
            build docker image: 
                from conda image
                copy kriging_app folder
                building environment
                run prepare_grid.py
                deploy app
        deploy: 
            register docker image to ghcr
