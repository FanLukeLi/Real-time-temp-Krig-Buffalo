stages of the pipeline: 
    build docker image <- current datetime as id
    register image <- GitHub Container Registry (Free tier)
    deploy <- Azure Kubernetes Service

    [3/29/2025]: the pipeline plan changed to the following, because integrating a python environment to prepare data for the app
                 to the Jenkins server is not efficient
        build: 
            build docker image: 
                from conda image
                copy kriging_app folder
                building environment
                run prepare_grid.py
                deploy app
        deploy: 
            register docker image to ghcr
            deploy with AKS

    [3/30/2025]: the pipeline changed to the following, because open-meteo API has access limit in free tier, deploying multiple
                 workers or replicas of the container will exceed the limit, in future builds, there will be one app collecting 
                 the data from open-meteo, but multiple workers or K8s pods for map access (frontend)
        build: 
            build docker image: 
                from conda image
                copy kriging_app folder
                building environment
                run prepare_grid.py
                deploy app
        deploy: 
            register docker image to ghcr

    [4/5/2025]: In docker image, added command to run the CMD as root, because of this change, the raster_map.html can be updated 
                by threads in the app. The next steps are: 
        - Changing the color map to make sure the same color for the same temperature
        - Integrating the build of docker image to Jenkins pipeline
        - Work out using Terraform to register image to ghcr and deploy with Azure webapp
        - Deploying the current app to Kubernetes can lead to asynchronous updates of the app

    [4/6/2025]: Building the image in Jenkins pipeline requires running docker agent in Jenkins network. To the repo owner's system, 
                it means running docker in docker, which is not recommended by docker official
        - Color map changed to same color for the same temperature
        - Integrated the build of docker image to GitHub Action
        - Working on using Terraform to register image to ghcr and deploy with Azure webapp
